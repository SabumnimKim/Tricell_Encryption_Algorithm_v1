# Encryption Algorithm Design

## Overview
This is an example of a simple encyrption algorithm using Caesar Cipher Wheel and Salt. 

The purpose is to teach beginners, first-year university students, algorithmic thinking, basic programming, and to create flow charts and plan for the code work. 

This is the base algorithm in one of the student projects within the university course "Introduction to IT", 5 ECTS offered by the Åland University of Applied Sciences.
